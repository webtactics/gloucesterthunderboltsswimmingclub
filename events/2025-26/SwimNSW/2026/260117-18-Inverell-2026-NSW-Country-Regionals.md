<strong>Save the date...</strong>

This year our choices are Inverell or Goulburn for country regional swimming (unless you want to go to Leeton). 

Personally we are heading out to Inverell to check out their brand new pool.  

This is a competition that does not require qualifying times. 

It is a very large event and a great experience if you want to give it a crack.
