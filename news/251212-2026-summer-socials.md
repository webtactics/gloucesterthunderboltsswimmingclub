We’re thrilled to announce four weeks of Summer Social Club Nights, beginning January 8th.
Entries as normal on Swim Central. 

If you have friends in town visiting or some new friend's who want to come and try this is a great time to bring them along as well. Just come to the pool at 530pm so I can add their entries in. 

These evenings are perfect for:
<ul>
<li>Kids to have fun, try new things, and enjoy a relaxed summer atmosphere.</li>
<li>If you have been thinking about trying a longer distance this is a great chance to test this out.</li>
<li>Parents to jump in, have a go, and maybe even race the kids!</li>
</ul>

It’s a wonderful opportunity for everyone to connect, play, and enjoy the water together. These 4 weeks do not count as club nights so if you are away don't worry about missing them.
