<h2>GTSC Points Score Round 1</h2>

We are over half way through our season and it is time to celebrate who is leading out top 10 competition. 

Each week our swimmers earn points based on how they swim against their own times. 

As our older swimmers move on it is very exciting to see our younger swimmers and some of our new members earning a spot in the top 10. 

Round 2 is proving to be very interesting there is no guessing who is actually going to end up on the top. Well done everyone on their results so far.
