Congratulations to Maximus Burgess, Olivia Lewis and Tomas Dellsperger who are the recipients of our 2024-25 Season Encouragement Awards. 

These swimmers showed up consistently and have all improved so much over the season. 

These awards are voted on by the GTSC committee, and are given to swimmers who consistently show up, do their best, whether they win or lose.

Swimmers may not win every race, but they always give their best effort and keep going.

Congratulations to Maximus Burgess who won the Kim Hebblewhite 7's and Under Encouragemewnt Award, Olivia Lewis who won the Leanne Wilkinson Encouragement Award and Tomas Dellsperger who won the Les Watt Encouragement Award, for the 2024/2025 season.
